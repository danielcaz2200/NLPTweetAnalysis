# NLPTweetAnalysis
NLP sentiment analysis in Python3 using the Selenium webdriver to scrape tweets.

This script scrapes tweets based off a search term and categorizes tweets by polarity (negative, neutral, positive) and visualizes common words associated with the search term, plots polarity vs subjectivity and shows the frequency of each sentiment category.

## Getting started:
1. Download the Chrome selenium driver that is closest to your current installation of chrome: [Download Link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
2. Place the chromedriver executable in your directory where the main.py is
3. Run pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Modify the search term in the main.py to your liking
5. Run the main.py script and enter your twitter password in the terminal to begin webscraping
